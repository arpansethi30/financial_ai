We are building a **Financial AI Agent** for a hackathon.  Remember it needs to be an AI Agent.
The agent will:  
✅ Analyze financial data  
✅ Generate insights  
✅ Make investment recommendations  
✅ Perform **sentiment analysis** using news newsapi & social media  
✅ Make a portofolio using ai for investment portfolios based on **age, income, and risk appetite**  and how long they plan to invest for. 

### **Tech Stack & Required Integrations**:
- **PyTorch, yFinance, OpenBB** (Financial Data & Modeling)  
- **Google Gemini** (Advanced AI Model)  
- **LlamaIndex** (Data Retrieval & Augmentation)  

I have created a test_code.py whgich is a streamlit app but we don't want to amke streamlit app we need to make a fastapi app and a nextjs app. Just see how we are implementing int that to craete our AI Agent.

### **Step 1: Build Minimal Version**
Implement **basic features first** using:
- **FastAPI backend** to handle AI processing and the next app we craeted name agent which is our front end app.
- Use **Gemini for insights** and **LlamaIndex for retrieval**

### **Step 2: Expand Features with Hackathon Sponsor Tools**
Once the minimal version works, integrate:
- **Stytch** → Authentication  
- **AgentQL** → Multi-step reasoning and web scraping  
- **ApertureDB** → Storing financial datasets  this is very improtnat to use and in a godo way bvecause they ahve great prizes for the hackthon winners.
- **Deep Lake** → Large-scale data management  
- **HappyRobot** → Automating portfolio monitoring  and send alerts to the user based on stco prices and also sentimental analysis 
- **Agno** → Personalization for different users  
- **ZenML** → ML pipeline management  

### **Task Breakdown for Cursor AI**
1️⃣ First, implement a basic front end next js app wihich anme is agent folder and backend  using LLamaindex,newsapi OpenBB, yFinance, and Gemini.  
3️⃣ Finally, integrate sponsor tools to improve depth & automation.  


in future I want to add paper trading using somehting free api like alpaca.
